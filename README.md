## Website produced for Front End Web Design Semester 1 2021
## Reflection

This project was the first time building a website with pure CSS & HTML by myself. Overall, I enjoyed the process and feel it has been beneficial for me in my journey as a designer. Initially, I had imagined this project would be a great challenge, however once ideas were drawn from Project 1 and progression was made through the modules on canvas, I found that this project was very interesting and quite enjoyable when the code came to life through the website.

Stage 1 of this project involved gathering inspiration from Project 1 and other sites online to provide the basis of my responsive website. I had two options: I could have focused primarily on the responsiveness of the site without giving too much thought to the design and aesthetics of the site or I could ensure I was developing the site to look sleek and modern from the beginning whilst ensuring responsiveness. I decided for the latter 
as I know just how important the look and feel of a website is. I also wanted to ensure I utilised the design brief I compiled within Project 1, this proved to be very helpful in the final design of Project 2.

Stage 2 of the project included working through canvas modules, watching YouTube videos and reading forums to work out how I would build my site. Many parts proved to be quite tedious and took many hours to figure out. This included my navigation which was originally going to be displayed horizontally in the header and change to a hamburger menu on smaller screens however that was changed to be just a hamburger menu in the final design.

Stage 3 was all about refining the site. There were plenty of responsiveness problems that needed addressing which forced me to change the general layout of my site.  After this came the validation of each page which ultimately turned out well. 

Other challenges that were faced included the footer. For reasons unknown there continued to be white space below my footer which was frustrating. I was able to fix this on all pages eventually however this did take some time. It turned out to be a simple fix.

More challenges included learning how to use media queries, resizing images on smaller screens and finally the overall layout of each page. The only major challenge I feel like I did not overcome was appropriate padding between text and images, I had planned for it to be a quick fix however it turned out to be a bigger job. Unfortunately, due to underestimating this problem, some of the padding and margins are not exactly how I would like them. As it is an obvious downfall within this project, I now understand that I need to plan more time for problems when building a site in the future.

Unfortunately, I had forgotten to take screenshots of my site in the early stages of this project which featured terrible colours and no images. Thankfully, the final design has come a long way since then. Ultimately, I feel like I made significant progress on this project and I am overall pleased with the final design.
